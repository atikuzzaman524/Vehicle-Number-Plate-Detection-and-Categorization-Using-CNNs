### Abstract:
Real-Time Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) has been a recurrent subject of research study as a result of many real-world implementations. Yet, numerous of today√¢s works are still not Full-bodied and consistent in real-world circumstances and rely on various constraints. Our proposed method to detect and recognize license plates in real-time that is particularly designed to work on videos captured by a camera. It is a distinct approach that is composed of three main phases like plate detection, class letter segmentation, and recognition. These phases are completed by adopting a HAAR Feature-based Classifier to detect license plate, class letter extractor with a proposed method, and Convolution Neural Network for recognizing class letters. Our given method achieved captivating results in our collected dataset. Our dataset composed of 5500 license plates and it achieved a successful recognition rate of 91.38% with approximately 30 frames/second. We evaluate our License Plate Detection system performance with 390 test images and we get 96.92% accuracy and Class Letter Segmentation has achieved 94.61% with the same size of data. We achieved an overall successful recognition rate of 90.90% with real-time performance.
